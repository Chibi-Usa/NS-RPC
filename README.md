# NS-RPC
The definitive way to display your Nintendo Switch games in Discord. ðŸŽ®

## Introduction
NS-RPC (Nintendo Switch Rich Presence) is an Electron app for Windows and macOS that allows every day Switch users to display
the game they're currently playing in their Discord status through a Rich Presence.

*As a developer, this was my first time ever using JavaScript for more than 5 minutes.
If I've made any obvious mistakes, please raise an issue or make a pr.*

### With NS-RPC you can..
* Display that you are using your Switch across all of Discord.
* Select from an extensive list of games to show off.
* Set a custom status message to let everyone know exactly what you're doing.
* Experience my questionable user interface.

## Prerequisites
All you need to get going is some common sense and the [Discord App](https://discordapp.com) installed to the same machine.

## Installing
If you're looking for convenience, you'll find already built copies of NS-RPC for 
both Windows and macOS [here](https://github.com/Da532/NS-RPC/releases). 

### From source

Running from the source *for whatever reason* is also possible. Simply install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and follow the instructions below.

Once installed, git clone or download and extract the source to a folder you're
comfortable working in. Open a terminal or command prompt and locate to the 
current directory using `cd path/to/directory`. 

You'll next need to install the required dependencies. This is simple and can be
done by simply typing into your terminal `npm .` which will grab all the needed
information from the package.json file.

Finally, to execute the application you simply need to enter into terminal `npm start`.

## Anything else?
Not as of yet. If you have feature suggestions or need support, head over to this handy [Discord server](https://discord.gg/StDcdMu) and talk to us.

Have a good one!
